# Rock-Paper-Scissors-World-Cup

This is a common game, rock, paper, scissors. Everyone knows it, but I decided to update the game on my own style. It is a world cup, and you are already on the final. You gonna play 10 games, against the computer. At the end the winner will be who have more points.
